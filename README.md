# MLOps Project - Vehicle Insurance Data Pipeline

Welcome to this MLOps project, designed to demonstrate a robust pipeline for managing vehicle insurance data. This project aims to impress recruiters and visitors by showcasing the various tools, techniques, services, and features that go into building and deploying a machine learning pipeline for real-world data management. Follow along to learn about project setup, data processing, model deployment, and CI/CD automation!

## üìÅ Project Setup and Structure

### Step 1: Project Template
- Start by executing the `template.py` file to create the initial project template, which includes the required folder structure and placeholder files.

### Step 2: Package Management
- Write the setup for importing local packages in `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` files.
- **Tip**: Learn more about these files from `crashcourse.txt`.

### Step 3: Virtual Environment and Dependencies
- Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
  ```bash
  conda create -n vehicle python=3.10 -y
  conda activate vehicle
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Verify the local packages by running:
  ```bash
  pip list
  ```

## üìä MongoDB Setup and Data Management

### Step 4: MongoDB Atlas Configuration
1. Sign up for [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a new project.
2. Set up a free M0 cluster, configure the username and password, and allow access from any IP address (`0.0.0.0/0`).
3. Retrieve the MongoDB connection string for Python and save it (replace `<password>` with your password).

### Step 5: Pushing Data to MongoDB
1. Create a folder named `notebook`, add the dataset, and create a notebook file `mongoDB_demo.ipynb`.
2. Use the notebook to push data to the MongoDB database.
3. Verify the data in MongoDB Atlas under Database > Browse Collections.

## üìù Logging, Exception Handling, and EDA

### Step 6: Set Up Logging and Exception Handling
- Create logging and exception handling modules. Test them on a demo file `demo.py`.

### Step 7: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
- Analyze and engineer features in the `EDA` and `Feature Engg` notebook for further processing in the pipeline.

---

## üì• Data Ingestion

### Step 8: Data Ingestion Pipeline
- Define MongoDB connection functions in `configuration.mongo_db_connections.py`.
- Develop data ingestion components in the `data_access` and `components.data_ingestion.py` files to fetch and transform data.
- Update `entity/config_entity.py` and `entity/artifact_entity.py` with relevant ingestion configurations.
- Run `demo.py` after setting up MongoDB connection as an environment variable.

### Setting Environment Variables
- Set MongoDB URL:
  ```bash
  # For Bash
  export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>...."
  # For Powershell
  $env:MONGODB_URL = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>...."
  ```
- **Note**: On Windows, you can also set environment variables through the system settings.

## üîç Data Validation, Transformation & Model Training

### Step 9: Data Validation
- Define schema in `config.schema.yaml` and implement data validation functions in `utils.main_utils.py`.

### Step 10: Data Transformation
- Implement data transformation logic in `components.data_transformation.py` and create `estimator.py` in the `entity` folder.

### Step 11: Model Training
- Define and implement model training steps in `components.model_trainer.py` using code from `estimator.py`.

---

## üåê AWS Setup for Model Evaluation & Deployment

### Step 12: AWS Setup
1. Log in to the AWS console, create an IAM user, and grant `AdministratorAccess`.
2. Set AWS credentials as environment variables.
   ```bash
   # For Bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
   ```

3. Configure S3 Bucket and add access keys in `constants.__init__.py`.

### Step 13: Model Evaluation and Pushing to S3
- Create an S3 bucket named `my-model-mlopsproj` in the `us-east-1` region.
- Develop code to push/pull models to/from the S3 bucket in `src.aws_storage` and `entity/s3_estimator.py`.

---

## üöÄ Model Evaluation, Model Pusher, and Prediction Pipeline

### Step 14: Model Evaluation & Model Pusher
- Implement model evaluation and deployment components.
- Create `Prediction Pipeline` and set up `app.py` for API integration.

### Step 15: Static and Template Directory
- Add `static` and `template` directories for web UI.

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Setup with Docker, GitHub Actions, and AWS

### Step 16: Docker and GitHub Actions
1. Create `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`.
2. Set up GitHub Actions with AWS authentication by creating secrets in GitHub for:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
   - `ECR_REPO`

### Step 17: AWS EC2 and ECR
1. Set up an EC2 instance for deployment.
2. Install Docker on the EC2 machine.
3. Connect EC2 as a self-hosted runner on GitHub.

### Step 18: Final Steps
1. Open the 5080 port on the EC2 instance.
2. Access the deployed app by visiting `http://<public_ip>:5080`.
